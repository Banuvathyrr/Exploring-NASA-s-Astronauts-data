The Data Science project 'Unveiling the Stars: An Exploratory Study on NASA Astronauts' involves data cleaning, exploration, information extraction and visualization using Python and MySQL. 
The dataset includes astronaut details like names, birthdates, gender, education, military history, space missions, and more. The goal was to uncover insights
into astronauts; demographics, careers, and achievements through descriptive statistics and data visualization.
